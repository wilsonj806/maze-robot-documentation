# Documentation folder read me

This folder has all the documentation that I produced before actually starting to code and make whatever assets required for the project. The project probably isn't big enough to warrant it, but I feel that it's worthwhile (also it took like 5 minutes to make the .html file after I finished planning everything out so that was kind of crazy)

One thing to note is that the CSS planning file assumes that I'll be using Sass to generate my CSS. If you don't know what [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) is, it's a CSS preprocessor that, depending on the user's skill, has to potential to greatly speed up or clean up your CSS workflow.
