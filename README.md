## Requirements:

Requirements done by FCC and [Link here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page)

## Personal Requirements:

- Use CSS/ Sass Variables at least once
- Use simple colors and play with transparency
- Functional over pretty
- Should have a toggle button that shows an element (via animation, like it should slide into view on clicking the button)
- Try to use CSS Grid although do note that it isn't supported on any Internet Explorer browser below V16
- Look into `@media print {}` so that you can hide the nav bar when you print the thing out
- Develop for mobile first again
- Use `code` elements to style any pieces of code shown
    - i.e if you show pieces of code, style them to be like Markdown code blocks
- Try integrating Sass into the workflow
- Use `@import` to import fonts into the CSS/ SCSS file instead of doing an html link
- Don't set any element's height unless it's a physical object and unless it's the nav
    
## Requirements Overview

- The project is probably meant to do a couple of things
    1. Practices good semantic HTML (labeling `header`, `section`, and etc rather than just using `h1`, `h2`, etc)
        - Also note that `header` is a tag that can and should be used multiple times unlike `h1`
    2. Make the web dev practice good documentation
    3. Make the web dev use layouts other than the single column layout
    4. Make the web dev create a nav bar without Bootstrap (it's not that hard but damn, bootstrap classes are nice)
- Also since it's a technical documentation page, you're probably not meant to spend a billion hours styling everything
    - So for this project, I'm just using the Angelist color palette for the most part
        - i.e whites, simple greys, blue for buttons and that's about it
